# Leveraging Port-Hamiltonian Theory for Impedance Control Benchmarking

This repository contains the simulation datasets from the tests scenarios present in the title paper.
To reproduce the simulations, clone the following packages:

- [impedance_reference_generator](https://github.com/qleonardolp/impedance_reference_generator)
- [ros2_impedance_controller](https://github.com/qleonardolp/ros2_impedance_controller)

On each repository are detailed instructions for the controller and the reference generator.
